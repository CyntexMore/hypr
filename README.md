# My Hyprland config

This is my Hyprland config.

## Change background

To change the background you'll have to use *hyprpaper* (see more [on the Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/)).

## Change cursor

You will have to change the cursor (with *xcursor*), unless you use [apple_cursor by ful1e5](https://github.com/ful1e5/apple_cursor). You can do this by editing the following line in the `hyprland.conf` config file.

```conf
XCURSOR_THEME=macOS ## of course change macOS to your desired cursor theme
XCURSOR_SIZE=24
```

Also change the cursor in *nwg-look* and *qt5ct*.

## The rest

You can figure the rest out by yourself.
