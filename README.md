# My Hyprland config

This is my Hyprland config.

## Requirements

To run my config, you'll need these software:

* wofi
* waybar
* hyprland
* yazi
* gsr-ui
* hyprpaper
* plasma-meta
* fcitx5
* grimblast
* hyprpicker

## Moving files

You should move the `config` and `style.css` to `~/.config/waybar`.

## Change background

To change the background you'll have to use *hyprpaper* (see more [on the Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/)).

## Change cursor

You will have to change the cursor, unless you use Breeze Light. You can do this by editing the following line in the `hyprland.conf` config file.

```conf
XCURSOR_THEME=Breeze Light
XCURSOR_SIZE=24
```

Also change the cursor in *nwg-look* and *qt5ct*.

## The rest

You can figure the rest out by yourself.
